I added some rules, called constraints, to my database to keep the data correct and connected. First, I used primary keys to make sure every order and product has a special ID that is not repeated. Then, in the order_details table, I used two columns together (orderID and productID) as a composite primary key so the same product doesnâ€™t get added twice in the same order. I also used foreign keys to link the tables. This means order_details can only use orderID values that are in the orders table, and productID values that are in the products table. These rules help the database stay organized and prevent mistakes.
